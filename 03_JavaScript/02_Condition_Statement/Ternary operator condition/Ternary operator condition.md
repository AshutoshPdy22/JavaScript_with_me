# Ternary operator condition


- The expression consists of three operands: the condition, value if true, and value if false.
- The evaluation of the condition should result in either a true/false or a boolean value.
- The true value lies between “?” & “:” and is executed if the condition returns true. Similarly, the false value lies after “:” and is executed if the condition returns false.
