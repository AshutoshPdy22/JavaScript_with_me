This help's us to explain JavaScript code more deeply, and to make it more readable. All output show in Browser console .

Basic Example :-
---

```barh
var x = 50;
Console.log(x); //50
Console.log(x +30); //80
console.log(!x >= 60); //true because not sign revers output
console.log([1,2,3]); //(3)[1,2,3]
```
Some Console for message:-
---

```barh
console.error("something went wrong");
console.table([1,2,3]);
console.warn("This is just warning");
console.clear();
```
Programe for check run time :-
---

```barh
console.time("test");
//write other code to
//see speed of time taken
console.timeEnd("test");
```
